### IDEA ###
We are going to make an app to to inform the user about any kind of disaster.
To do this task our app will be having some features like:-
- GPS tracking.
- Daily Weather Report
- Alert
- Lost/Found
- Public Portal
- Rescue team member Portal
- Portal for NGO.
- Nearest Rescue camp
- Guidelines


### <u> PUBLIC PORTAL </u> : ###
- Their personal and Family Details.
- General Guidelines of different types of Disaster.
- Direct Message to help centers.
- Direct linking to their Family members.
- Map to Navigate them to help centers.
- Alert and Details of Natural Disaster going to happen.
- Nearest rescue Camp details.

### <u> RESCUE TEAM MEMBER PORTAL </U> : ###
- Details of Number of People and their Location.
- Tutorial video's on how to help.
- Atomatic team formation of members from same area.
- <b> Notification/Alerts </b> about Disaster.
- Feature to send direct message to NGO.
- They will get analysis of Disaster and details of number of people.
- Contacts of nearest NGO.


### <u> PORTAL FOR NGO </u> :###
